// This class implements a permanently-cancelled CancellationToken.
// It is a lightweight singleton used anywhere a token is required, but work must be treated as already canceled.

/**
 * A singleton {@link CancellationToken} that is permanently cancelled.
 * <p>
 * Useful for APIs that require a token, when the operation should be treated as
 * already cancelled. Callbacks registered via {@link #onCancel(Runnable)} are
 * invoked immediately. {@link #cancel()} is a no-op and returns {@code false}.
 * Child tokens created via {@link #child()} are also pre-cancelled (returns {@code this}).
 * </p>
 *
 * <p><strong>Thread-safety:</strong> This instance is immutable and safe to reuse.</p>
