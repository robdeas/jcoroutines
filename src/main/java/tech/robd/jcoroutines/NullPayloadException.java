/**
 * Thrown when a {@code null} payload is observed on a channel that does not allow {@code null} values.
 * <p>
 * For mixed Kotlin/Java scenarios, prefer {@link InteropChannel} which represents nullable elements
 * via {@link java.util.Optional#empty()} at the API boundary, or use helpers that skip {@code null}
 * values when appropriate (e.g., {@code receiveIgnoreNulls()} where provided).
 * </p>
 *
 * <p><strong>When you might see this:</strong> If a producer accidentally enqueues {@code null} into a
 * non-null {@code Channel<T>}, the consumer may fail fast with this exception to highlight a
 * contract violation. Interop channels use a dedicated sentinel and never store raw {@code null}.</p>
