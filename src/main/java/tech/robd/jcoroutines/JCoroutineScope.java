/**
 * A scope for structured concurrency operations.
 * <p>
 * A {@code JCoroutineScope} owns an {@link Executor} and provides entry points to launch
 * suspending work expressed as {@link SuspendRunnable} / {@link SuspendFunction} lambdas.
 * All work launched through the scope inherits cancellation when the scope is {@link #close() closed}.
 * </p>
 *
 * <h2>Key principles</h2>
 * <ul>
 *   <li><strong>Structured:</strong> child operations are associated with the scope and can be
 *   cancelled together.</li>
 *   <li><strong>Explicit context:</strong> suspendable code receives a {@link SuspendContext}
 *   argument that exposes cancellation and timing primitives.</li>
 *   <li><strong>Interop:</strong> Java callers get {@link CompletableFuture}-based handles via
 *   {@link JCoroutineHandle#result()} and can use {@link #runBlocking(SuspendFunction)} to bridge
 *   into blocking code paths when needed.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p><strong>Thread-safety:</strong> Implementations are expected to be thread-safe; cancellation
 * signals should propagate promptly to child operations.</p>
