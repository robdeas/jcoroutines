/**
 * A singleton {@link CancellationToken} that is permanently <em>not cancelled</em>.
 * <p>
 * This token is useful for code paths that require a token but should always behave
 * as if cancellation will never occur (e.g., tests, no-op adapters, or long-lived
 * background services that don't support external cancellation).
 * </p>
 *
 * <p><strong>Semantics:</strong></p>
 * <ul>
 *   <li>{@link #isCancelled()} is always {@code false}.</li>
 *   <li>{@link #onCancel(Runnable)} returns a no-op registration and never invokes the callback.</li>
 *   <li>{@link #onCancelQuietly(Runnable)} is a no-op.</li>
 *   <li>{@link #child()} returns {@code this} (children are also never cancelled).</li>
 *   <li>{@link #cancel()} returns {@code true} to acknowledge the request, but does not change state.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p><strong>Thread-safety:</strong> This instance is immutable and safe for reuse.</p>
