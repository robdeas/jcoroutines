/**
 * A runnable-like functional interface whose body executes with an explicit {@link SuspendContext}.
 * <p>
 * This is the Java interop shape for a Kotlin {@code suspend () -> Unit}-style block:
 * the context is passed explicitly to enable cooperative cancellation, delay, and
 * dispatcher access from Java without compiler magic.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>Typical usage:</p>
 * <pre>{@code
 * SuspendRunnable task = suspend -> {
 *     suspend.delay(50);
 *     // do work, throw checked exceptions if needed
 * };
 * }</pre>
